#  Challenge Day 19: UnitConversions

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19
## Your challenge
> You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.

Which units you choose are down to you, but you could choose one of these:

* Temperature conversion: users choose `Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin`.
* Length conversion: users choose `meters, kilometers, feet, yards, or miles`.
* Time conversion: users choose `seconds, minutes, hours, or days`.
* Volume conversion: users choose `milliliters, liters, cups, pints, or gallons`.
---

###  If you were going for length conversion you might have:

* A segmented control for meters, kilometers, feet, yard, or miles, for the input unit.
* A second segmented control for meters, kilometers, feet, yard, or miles, for the output unit.
* A text field where users enter a number.
* A text view showing the result of the conversion.
> So, if you chose meters for source unit and feet for output unit, then entered 10, you’d see 32.81 as the output.

## Tips
You already know everything you need to complete this project, but if you’re hitting problems then I have some tips that might help.

* First, all our unit conversions are simple mathematics, but you shouldn’t try to write conversions to go from every source unit to very other unit. A better idea is to convert the user’s input to a single base unit, then convert from there to the target unit.

* So, rather than writing code to convert from liters to milliliters, and from liters to cups, and from liters to pints, and so on, a better idea is to convert the user’s input into milliliters (the lowest common denominator), then convert from there to whatever output unit they want.

* Even though you can absolutely complete this project using simple arithmetic, you might be interested to know that Apple does give us dedicated functionality for doing unit conversion – see my article [How to convert units using Unit and Measurement](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-convert-units-using-unit-and-measurement) if you’re curious. However, I should reiterate that it is not required to complete this project: you can convert from liters to pints (for example) just by multiplying the input by 2.11338.

* As we have three user values here – their input number, their input unit, and their output unit – you need to have **three** @State properties to store them all. You’ll need a textfield plus two segmented controls, plus a text view to show your output, and that’s about it.

So, go ahead and get started now. Don’t worry if you need to refer back to the WeSplit project – that’s perfectly normal, and is all part of the learning process.

Good luck! You can do this. And once you’re done, tell other people: you’ve built another SwiftUI app, and this one was entirely designed by you.

You should be proud of what you’ve accomplished.
